Prompt: I'm creating a personal website. I have two pages, index.html and education.html.  
I want a third page, skills.html, to showcase my skills in different categories.  I want this to be done in a 
creative eye catching way, but also be quickly readable for potential  employers. I'm going to give you the code 
for index and education for reference, and I would like  you to keep the same nav bar and footer, but everything 
else is up to you. The footer has a dropdown  color selector and I would like that implemented somewhere on the screen 
as well (for ex: on index.html  clicking the color selector changes the color of tags). Also include the dark/light mode 
feature. Here are the skills I would like you to present. "Programming Languages: TypeScript Java Python C++ CSS Frontend: 
React Next.js Backend: Node.js Express.js Prisma PostgreSQL Developer Tools: Vercel Git Postman Certifications: SANS GFACT" 
Ill attach the js for the color selector and dark mode selector.  Create the full skills.html webpage for me. 
Put the css in a separate file.

- attached index.html, education.html, main.js

Note: Claude ran out of free usage before it could finish the javascript for this page,
so I gave the code to Deepseek to create the js file
