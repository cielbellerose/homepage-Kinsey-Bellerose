## Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a personal homepage that highlights my **projects, skills, coursework, and experiences** in a visually consistent and user-friendly way.  

The website is structured into multiple sections/pages:  
- **Homepage (index.html):** Introduction and project highlights.  
- **Education (education.html):** Courses and activities with an interactive course viewer chart.  
- **Skills (skills.html):** AI generated Skills overview, styled with custom CSS.  

---

## Creative Additions  
- **Interactive Course Viewer Chart** (Education page) â€“ dynamic visualization of courses.  
- **Vanilla JS Features**:  
  - **Dark Mode Toggle** for theme switching.  
  - **Footer Color Picker** for interactive style customization.  

These demonstrate both JavaScript interactivity and creative customization beyond standard content.
